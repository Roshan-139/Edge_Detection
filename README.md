Project Title: Edge Detection with OpenCV

Description:
This project implements a simple edge detection algorithm using OpenCV in Python. Edge detection is a fundamental technique in computer vision used to identify points in a digital image where the image brightness changes sharply or has discontinuities. The script processes an input image and produces an output image highlighting the detected edges.

Key Features:

Utilizes OpenCV for image processing.
Implements the Canny edge detection algorithm.
Provides visualization of both the original image and the detected edges.
Supports customization of edge detection parameters.
